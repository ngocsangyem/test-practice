#### Install dependency

```sh
npm install
```

#### Test

```sh
npm run test
```

Three difference test:

- Fully Isolated: Unit test

	Ex: Testing one function

- With dependencies: Intergration tests

	Ex: Testing a function that calls a function

- Full flow: End-toEnd (E2E) tests

	Ex: Validating a DOM after a click
